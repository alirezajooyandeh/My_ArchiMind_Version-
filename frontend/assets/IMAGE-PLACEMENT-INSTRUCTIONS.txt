IMPORTANT: Place your architectural background image here!

File name: bg-architecture.png
Location: frontend/assets/bg-architecture.png

The image should be:
- High resolution (1920x1080 or larger recommended)
- Format: PNG, JPG, or JPEG
- This will be used as the background for both:
  * Landing page (http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
  * MVP application (http://127.0.0.1:8000/app)

Once you place the image file here, restart the server and the background will appear.

To test if the image is accessible:
