TO ADD BACKGROUND IMAGE:

1. Place your background image file in this directory with one of these names:
   - background.jpg
   - background.jpeg  
   - background.png

2. The image will automatically appear as the background of the application.

3. If the image doesn't show:
   - Make sure the file name is exactly "background.jpg" (or .jpeg/.png)
   - Restart the server after adding the image
   - Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Check the browser console for any 404 errors
